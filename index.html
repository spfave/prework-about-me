    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Sebastian and I am participating in a web development bootcamp because I want to pursue a new career
      challenge.
    </p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>
      I grew up in Virginia Beach, VA but my family is original from Switzerland.
    </p>

    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>
      I'm an avid hiker who also enjoys running and climbing. I recently tried skiing for the first time and had a great
      time so I'm already thinking about some future winter trip adventures. I am also very interested in personal
      technology and eagerly follow the consumer tech news space.
    </p>

    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>
      Being a tech pundit, but I'll gladly take a career role that lets me exercise my technical knowledge to help solve
      customer problems and develop tailored solutions to their needs till that day comes.
    </p>

    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy life from Fairfax County in northern Virginia.
    </p>

    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>
      My background is in engineering, but personal technology has always been a fascination of mine. Throughout my
      engineering education and career I've dabbled in program scripting and enjoyed the process of developing
      functionality, testing it, and ultimately using it to solve a problem. Becoming a developer is attractive to
      me because of this continuous cyclic workflow and the wide breath of knowledge available to be learned. Web
      development is of particular interest because of the scale of the available market and the versatility of
      challenges that can be addressed.
    </p>
